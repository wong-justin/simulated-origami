A programming/simulation project to visualize an origami theorem. Intended for educational use.

Inspired by Erik Demaine's viedo lectures.

Known Issues:
- Saving more than once crashes
- Clicking "Cancel" in the save dialog crashes
- Clicking the top-right [X] on the save dialog crashes
- Clicking help more than once crashes
- Clicking "Make Foldable" with a blank canvas crashes; need to fix method with array to account for this case
- Clicking "Fold It!" with a blank canvas crashes; see above

Fixed Issues:
- Angles are not correct, especially around 180 degrees; need to fix math

Other Notes:
- The .classpath file for the project for eclipse is modified if the reference libraries have a different path
	(ie different computer)
	- I should try to have 2 copies of the .classpath file to toggle between home/school
- There may be non-disposed resources

Features to add:
- Other demo types (eg. 1D flat folding, fold and one cut)
- Undo feature
- Save as other file (eg. vector image, custom file type that saves points/angles?)
