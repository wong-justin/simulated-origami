A programming/simulation project to visualize an origami theorem. 
Intended for educational use. It is made as an SWT Project in Eclipse.

Inspired by Erik Demaine's video lectures.

Known Issues:
- Saving more than once crashes
- Clicking "Cancel" in the save dialog crashes
- Clicking the top-right [X] on the save dialog crashes
- Clicking help more than once crashes
- Clicking "Make Foldable" with a blank canvas crashes; need to fix method with array to account for this case
- Clicking "Fold It!" with a blank canvas crashes; see above

Fixed Issues:
- Incorrect angles, especially around 180 degrees

Other Notes:
- The .classpath file for the project for eclipse is modified if the reference libraries have a different path
	(i.e. different computer)
	- I should try to have 2 copies of the .classpath file to toggle between home/school
- There may be non-disposed resources because of some unfamiliarity with SWT
- Should the program icon be a different file type (e.g. gif or ico)?

Features to add:
- Other demo types (eg. 1D flat folding, fold and one cut)
- Undo feature
- Save as other file (eg. vector image, custom file type that saves points/angles?)
